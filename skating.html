   <h2> As of Febuary 27, 2022, I am currently working on my double toe and double loop as I landed my double salchlow in January 2022 and my Axel in October 2019. I landed my double salchlow in january 2019 but I lost it for 3 years and have just landed it again! I landed my double toe-loop on March 11, 2020, two days before the whole economy shut down, so as you'd expect, I lost that and I'm still working to get that back. I think that the global pandemic has made me stronger as a skater because I've trained more off-ice then ever and ever imagined; 7 year old me would hate to train to do off-ice training everyday, but that is the reality of this pandemic. All of the off-ice training that I've done with dozens of different trainers in programs such as the "One Team Movement" organization and taking classes from "Skate Ontario" programs. Including meeting Kurt Browning on zoom. As annoying as this pandemic has been with constant 1-2 month breaks in the middle of nowhere, I have learned to appreciate every single minute I have on the ice!
